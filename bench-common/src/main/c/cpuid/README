Every single time I've implemented dynamic CPU feature dispatch that 
relies on optional processor feature extensions or basic 
processor-specific variables I've had to write up yet another cpuid 
abstraction layer (meaning I've had to refer back again to the manuals). 
The "cpuid" package provided here is meant to be a very simple feature 
detection interface that you can easily integrate into your project. 
Just copy in cpuid.h and cpuid.c. Please see cpuid.h for additional 
documentation. Please see tool.c for a very simple example program. For 
criticism, corrections, patches and other contributions please contact 
the current maintainer at sbahra@repnop.org.
